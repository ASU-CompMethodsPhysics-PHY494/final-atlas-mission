ATLAS

Bobby Hackett, Jordan Pagni, Alex Warren

Our goal was to model the trajectory of a spacecraft, ATLAS, as it made its way to Saturn's moon Titan, on a journey of astrobiological exploration. The first step was to simulate a dynamic solar system of seven massive bodies that interact gravitationally. Each body is given an initial position and velocity--relative to the Sun at the origin--using values from real astronomical data. The positions of each body are calculated as a function of velocity, which itself depends on the force of gravity between bodies. Using a `for` loop, we iterate through a predetermined number of timesteps--updating the current positions, velocities, and gravitational forces. Once the solar system was complete, we added ATLAS. The spacecraft behaves just like any other body, but with an initial mass, position, and velocity, that are based on both real and hypothetical space exploration missions. Through careful analysis of many ATLAS trajectory simulations, we were able to project initial conditions that lead to a successful intercept with Titan. We didn't fulfill all of our hoped for objectives, but with more time, the ATLAS mission would have: placed ATLAS in a stable orbit in the Titan-Saturn system, utilized gravity assist maneuvers, and calculated the fuel expenditure on route.
